## Welcome to Econblog

This is a place where I post short studies tracking the U.S. economy during COVID and the changes relevant to the labor market. I also take a historical perspective to understand how recent changes stand compared to past shocks and recessions. 

### Changes in the U.S. Labor Market in 2020

Female labor force participation rose dramatically from 1970s to 2000 and then stagnated. Male labor force participation rate declined since the 1970s. I look into the reasons using the Current Population Survey.

I survey labor force participation, employment and unemployment rates and examine the differences for men and women. Women have been more impacted, but the difference in the impact is shrinking over time.

I examine the geographical distribution of the impact of COVID on unemployment rates in the U.S. The states most impacted and slowest to recover are states highly dependent on tourism and entertainment and states with high population density and large urban centers.
