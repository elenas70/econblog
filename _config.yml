  My name is Elena Stolpovsky. I have a PhD in Economics. My thesis was about economic decision-making of househoods - a topic that fascinates me, for some reason, but is not very popular or applicable.
  You are free to check out my <a href="https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/51472/">my thesis</a>, and let me know what you think.
  <br>I worked in the energy industry and care about sustainable energy generation and sustainable development in general.
