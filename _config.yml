  Welcome to my blog. My name is Elena Stolpovsky. I am interested in economics, society and technology.
  <br>As a graduate student I researched economic decision-making of househoods - a topic that fascinates me, for some reason, but is not very popular or applicable.
  Please check out my <a href="https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/51472/">my thesis</a>, and let me know what you think.
  <br>I worked in the energy industry and became passionate about sustainable energy generation and sustainable development in general.
  <br>I currently am currently engaged in independent research and work on ad-hoc projects. Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/estolpovsky/">LinkedIn</a> with comments about my blog, research ideas and project suggestions!
